The main screen is where all of the items, tags, and layouts are shown.<br>
Items can be edited and added to layouts to group common ideas together.<br>
### Searching & Filtering

Items can be found faster with the search bar and tags.<br>
Tags can either be required or unwanted to narrow down a search as much as required.<br>
### Tag Editor

Tags are edited in a seperate window where they can be have their name, background colour, and importance changed.<br>
Importance is used to help sort the tags beyond just alphabetically.<br>
This makes it easier to keep more important tags at the top of the list, and group similar tags together.<br>
### NEW - Images in Notes

Images can be added to notes to give extra context or visuals.<br>
Images can be aligned to the top, left, or right of the note's content.<br>
They can be resized by dragging the border between the image and the content.<br>
Selecting images are the same as selecting icons for items and can be from the local file system or online.
