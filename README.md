Items can be edited and added to layouts to group common ideas together.<br>
### Searching & Filtering

Items can be found faster with the search bar and tags.<br>
Tags can either be required or unwanted to narrow down a search as much as required.<br>
### Tag Editor

Tags are edited in a seperate window where they can be have their name, background colour, and importance changed.<br>
Importance is used to help sort the tags beyond just alphabetically.<br>
This makes it easier to keep more important tags at the top of the list, and group similar tags together.
